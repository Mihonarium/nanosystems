Science magazine calls Eric Drexler "Mr. Nanotechnology." For years, Drexler has stirred controversy by declaring that molecular nanotechnology will bring a sweeping technological revolution-delivering tremendous advances in miniaturization, materials, computers, and manufacturing of all kinds. Now, he's written a detailed, top-to-bottom analysis of molecular machinery - how to design it, how to analyze it, and how to build it.

*Nanosystems* is the first scientifically detailed description of developments that will revolutionize most of the industrial processes and products currently in use. This groundbreaking work draws on physics and chemistry to establish basic concepts and analytical tools. The book then describes nanomechanical components, devices, and systems, including parallel computers able to execute $10^{20}$ instructions per second and desktop molecular manufacturing systems able to make such products. Via chemical and biochemical techniques, proximal probe instruments, and software for computer-aided molecular design, the book charts a path from present laboratory capabilities to advanced molecular manufacturing.

Bringing together physics, chemistry, mechanical engineering, and computer science, *Nanosystems* provides an indispensable introduction to the emerging field of molecular nanotechnology.

**K. ERIC DREXLER** published the first scientific paper on molecular nanotechnology ir. 1981. In addition, he taught the first course on the subject (at Stanford University) and chaired the first two conferences. He is currently President of the Foresight Institute and a Research Fellow of the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing. He wrote Nanosystems while a Visiting Scholar at the Stanford University Department of Computer Science and continues to lecture at universities and corporations in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. He received his doctoral degree in molecular nanotechnology from MIT.

[^0]:    Words appearing in the Glossary are sometimes prefixed with a small circle, e.g., ${ }^{\circ}$ steric.

[^52]: Considering the words in isolation, the terms molecular nanotechnology and molecular manufacturing could instead be interpreted to include much of chemistry, and mechanosynthesis could be interpreted to include substantial portions of enzymology and molecular biology. These established fields, however, are already named; the above terms will serve best if reserved for the fields they have been coined to describe, or for borderline cases that emerge as these fields are developed.

[^1]:    D. Cram has introduced the concept of an inner phase to describe the interior of container molecules in which (for example) single, isolated molecules of cyclobutadiene are stable at room temperature because the container walls block intermolecular collisions (Cram et al., 1991). Inner-phase systems prevent collisions; machine-phase systems control them.

[^57]: Product scale, defect rates, and cycle times vary widely from process to process within most of these families; feature scale varies widely within the first two.

[^58]: The defect rate listed for biochemistry corresponds to high-reliability DNA replication processes that include kinetic proofreading (Watson et al., 1987); most biochemical defect rates are higher. All rates are on a per-component basis.

[^2]:    The term nanotechnology, first widely used to refer to what is here termed molecular nanotechnology, has since been applied to many small-scale technologies, including conventional microfabrication techniques working in the submicron size range. Accordingly, discussions of the history, status, and prospects of so-called nanotechnology often confuse essentially dissimilar concepts, as if the term ornithology were used to describe the study of flying things, thereby stirring together birds, bats, spacecraft, balloons, and bombers into a single conceptual muddle.

[^53] † Discussions phrased in terms of controlling and building with "individual atoms" (Drexler, 1986a) have fostered a perception that molecular manufacturing would employ individual, unbonded, and hence highly reactive carbon atoms. This rightly strikes chemists as implausible. Indeed, unbound atoms would be difficult to produce and control; more conventional reactants seemed appropriate from the start. The same volume speaks of using "reactive molecules" as tools "to bond atoms together.... few at a time," and the first paper on the subject (Drexler, 1981) speaks of positioning "reactants" and "reactive groups." Controlling the motions and reactions of individual molecules, of course, implies controlling the motions and destinations of their individual constituent atoms.

[^3]:    It is sometimes suggested that artificial molecular machine systems cannot improve on biological systems because the latter have been shaped by billions of years of evolution. In specific engineering parameters, however, the products of evolution have already been surpassed: graphite composites are stronger than bone, copper is more conductive than axonal cytoplasm, and so forth. Biological systems do, however, excel in their capacity to evolve, and it can be shown that several of their characteristic differences from eutactic nanomechanical systems (including the use of diffusive transport rather than mechanical conveyance) are important to this capacity (Drexler, 1989a).

[^59]: Values included only to illustrate the failure of the scaling law.

[^60]: Values omitted; realistic geometries would require several arbitrary parameters.

[^4]:    Relativistic effects in heavy atoms cause strong spin-orbit coupling, which can increase the rate of electronic transitions such as the flipping of unpaired electron spins in free radicals, with consequent effects on the rates of chemical reactions (Section 8.4.4b). For typical molecules of interest, however, spin-orbit coupling does not significantly affect structure or dynamics before or after the transition.

[^5]:    The basic nature of the equation suggests why calculations are difficult. Using samples at 10 points to approximate the integral of a one-dimensional function is often easy, though not always very accurate. But consider a function in a 126-dimensional space: sampling a $10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 \times \ldots$ grid would require an impossible $10^{126}$ function evaluations. Solving a differential equation with boundary conditions is generally more difficult than integration, and finding a wave function for the electrons in benzene, for example, presents a problem of this sort in a 126-dimensional space.

[^6]:    Calculations using different basis sets or corrections for electron correlation are described as being at different "levels of theory." They might better be described as different levels of approximation, with the more accurate levels converging on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to the Schrödinger equation.

[^7]:     Modeling of 'lone pairs as pseudoatoms with bond-bending interactions incorrectly prohibits the inversion of ${ }^{\circ}$ amines, a process in which the lone pair smoothly redistributes to the other face of the group. To picture a lone pair, first imagine a methane molecule, tetrahedral $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$. Now imagine that one of the $\mathrm{H}$ nuclei (a proton) is somehow moved to the carbon nucleus: the result is ammonia, $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. What happens to the two electrons that previously formed a $\mathrm{CH}$ bond? They remain in the same region, but having no proton to attract them, they spread to occupy more space. This bulge of electron density is the nitrogen lone pair, modeled in MM2 by burying an atomlike object in the outer regions of the $\mathbf{N}$ atom. Oxygen is treated as having two lone-pair pseudoatoms, but in fluorine the three lone pairs blend into a distribution treated as symmetric; neon has perfect spherical symmetry.

[^8]:     The Schrödinger equation in the form given by Eq. (3.1) assumes electrostatic interactions between all particles everywhere, which cannot be quite right: electrons move, and the speed of light is finite, and so the fields must lag. In a theoretician's world in which fields propagate instantaneously, interactions are termed nonretarded and often have simpler mathematical descriptions. Owing to retardation, London dispersion forces at large separations fall off as $r^{-7}$ rather than the $r^{-6}$ stated by Eq. (3.28); this is described by the Casimir-Polder equation. In solution, retardation effects are important at separations greater than $\sim 5 \mathrm{~nm}$ (Israelachvili, 1992).

[^61]: Hamaker constants for metals from Israelachvili (1992). Values for $n, \varepsilon$ from Gray (1972), Lide (1990).

[^9]:     This is not universal: metal surfaces (for example) would undergo bonding rather than repulsion; potential functions are discussed in Israelachvili (1992).

[^10]:     Which requires that classical and quantum mechanics give the same answers in the limit of large quantum numbers.

[^55]: State is an overworked word. Here, it refers to a region of configuration space; in Section 4.3.2b, it referred to a single point in phase space (= configuration space $x$ momentum space). When a thermally excited nanomechanical system is described as being in some particular state of practical significance, this cannot refer to a point, and typically refers to a region in configuration space of the sort discussed here.

[^11]:     More concretely, consider a system that could be in either of two deep, stable potential wells (e.g., a cylinder divided into two compartments by a piston in the middle, with a gas molecule in one or the other). To convert this into a system with a single well, the two wells can be merged symmetrically by dropping the barrier between them (by removing the piston), or asymmetrically (by moving the piston to one end of the cylinder, then removing it). Relative to symmetrical merging, asymmetrical merging can yield more free energy (the one-molecule gas expands against the moving piston, doing work), but only if some external record indicates which well is occupied (enabling a mechanism to choose the right direction for the motion). Proposals to gain this freeenergy increment by observing an initially unknown state can be made quite confusing but prove futile; if successful, they would enable violations of the second law of thermodynamics. Section 7.6.2 analyzes well-merging processes in more detail.

[^12]:     The uncertainty principle stated here is implicit in all the later derivations based on quantum mechanical principles, for example, those of Chapter 5.

[^13]:     The configuration coordinates used to describe a well are assumed to be aligned with the principal axes of the hyperellipsoids describing equipotential surfaces; motion along one of these coordinates corresponds to a normal mode.

[^14]:     A process that equilibrates different states can be described as freezing when the transitions that establish equilibrium effectively cease, that is, when they become rare on the time scale under consideration. Often this occurs because the temperature falls; here it occurs because the barrier height increases. The result is a frozen distribution.

[^15]:     The four-membered ring in 6.1 resembles cyclobutadiene, which is stable at room temperature if intermolecular collisions are blocked (Cram et al., 1991).

[^16]:     Based on difficulties arising in silicon micromachine research, P. Barth has raised concerns regarding electrostatic stiction and repulsion caused by charging of moving parts. Micromachines have irregular surface structures with sliding interfaces subject to highenergy processes including bond breakage, wear, and tribological charge separation; these phenomena can be avoided in nanomechanical systems. Dissimilar insulating surfaces brought into contact can transfer charge by a combination of thermal activation and tunneling, but only if the energies of occupied electronic states in one object approach those of unoccupied states in the other; avoiding this can impose design constraints (an experimental study of contact electrification forces is reported in Horn and Smith, 1992).

[^17]:     Note, however, that stiff positional control of reactants can make predictions of the ratios of reaction rates among competing reaction pathways quite insensitive even to large errors in predicted transition-state energies (Section 4.4.3c). Further, the equilibrium results of highly exoergic reactions can be predicted with confidence despite substantial errors in calculating the energies of the reactants and products. Thus, the results of many mechanosynthetic reactions can be predicted with ample confidence despite errors in calculated energies that would be unacceptable in predicting the results of typical solution-phase reactions.

[^18]:     Pressure in piezochemistry plays a fundamentally different role from pressure in gasphase reactions. In the gas phase, so-called pressure effects on kinetics and equilibria have no direct relationship to the applied force per unit area, being mediated entirely by changes in molecular number density and resulting changes in collision frequencies. In the gas phase, the PES describing an elementary reaction process is independent of pressure, since each collision occurs (locally) in vacuum, free of applied forces. Likewise, so-called pressure effects in liquid and solid-surface environments exposed to reactive gases usually result more from changes in molecular number density than from piezochemical modifications to the PES of the reaction. (Section 6.3.1 outlines the concept of a PES dependent on boundary conditions, such as pressure.)

[^54]: † In polar, solution-phase systems, the effects of solvent reorganization can be large, and bond-forming but charge-neutralizing reactions can have positive volumes of activation: the polar solvent, freed of strong fields, relaxes and expands.

[^19]:     Note, however, that convergent, "structure-directed" synthesis strategies (Ashton et al., 1989) can loosen this constraint by combining larger fragments in a manner analogous to biological self-assembly. Distinctive features of larger-scale structures then guide the reactions, with no obvious bound on the feasible complexity of the products.

[^62]: Values in this range are seldom achieved.

[^20]:     Note, however, that a convergent synthesis can reduce the asymmetry of the reagent application process; see Section 8.6.6.

[^21]:     Strongly polar tip structures may mitigate this problem.

[^22]:    "It is no exaggeration to claim a major role for carbenes in the modern chemist's attitude that he can very probably make anything he wants." (Baron et al., 1973)

[^23]:     E. Tribble has emphasized the importance of such supporting structures for separating degrees of freedom in a system and thereby simplifying design and analysis.

[^24]:     The two conditions compatible with zero energy dissipation are zero sliding resistance and zero slip. Interfaces with smooth potentials can approximate zero resistance at low sliding speeds; interfaces with strongly corrugated potentials can exhibit zero slip (though the interface deforms and other energy dissipation mechanisms intervene).

[^25]:     The concept of spectral density stems from the analysis of waves carrying power. The power spectral density of a radio transmission, for example, measures its power per unit frequency-range (substantial in a narrow band of radio wavelengths, negligible at $x$-ray wavelengths), and can be derived from the time-domain shape of the emitted electromagnetic wave by Fourier transform methods. These methods are equally applicable to functions in the spatial domain, but the resulting "power spectral density" has a purely nominal relationship to power. An amplitude spectral density is proportional to the square root of a power spectral density. Because only ratios of values are considered here, units for these quantities are omitted.

[^26]:     This discussion implicitly assumes that modification of surface sites does not make compatible-framework structures incompatible. Strains introduced by modifying the sliding surface will have little effect on the constrained surface if the separation is adequate ( $\sim 1 \mathrm{~nm}$ ), and if the modifications do not cause large net tensile or compressive stresses. These conditions will often be met. Where they are not, the conversion of compatible to incompatible structures by distortions induced by surface modification will, in typical design problems, be balanced statistically by the conversion of incompatible structures to compatible structures by similar distortions. In circumstances where this is significant, however, the task of designing a sliding surface cannot be treated separately from the task of designing a compatible framework.

[^27]:     A bearing interface can support a net tensile load yet retain a positive stiffness.

[^28]:     Conventional springs, in which force is approximately proportional to displacement, can be implemented in many ways. Most stable diamondoid structures (as well as many rod and cage structures of lower compliance and less diamondlike structure) are perfectly elastic, save for energy dissipation mechanisms that depend on the speed of deformation.

[^29]:     If this could be done by a mere molecular ratchet, the complex machinery of photosynthesis and digestion might never have evolved.

[^30]:     Under some conditions, Coulomb blockade effects (Barner and Ruggiero, 1987; Kuzmin et al., 1989) can become important. In particular, if the tunnel resistance is large compared to the quantum unit of resistance $\pi \hbar / 2 e^{2} \approx 6.5 \times 10^{3} \Omega$, then electrons will be sufficiently well localized that a rim electrode can be viewed as having a discrete number of electrons. If, in addition, the change in electrostatic energy caused by adding one electronic charge ( $e^{2} / 2 C$, where $C$ is the electrode capacitance) is large compared to $k T$, then the mean charge will vary in a staircase fashion, rather than smoothly. Under these conditions, a more uniform rate of charging can be achieved if the potential induced by work-function effects changes swiftly in the range where the mean equilibrium charge approximates an integral number, and more slowly in the range around half-integral values.

[^31]:     At this size scale, liquid structure effects can be important. Designs having small liquid-filled gaps with adverse geometrical and surface properties could produce solidlike ordering among small feedstock molecules (Section 11.4.1a). At ordinary temperatures, however, different choices of geometry and surface structure should avoid this problem, but bulk-phase viscosity values should be taken as no more than a rough guide to liquid behavior near surfaces.

[^32]:     The chemical stability of liquid ethyne itself at this pressure (in small volumes of pure substance, bounded by inert walls) is an open question; polymerization is exoergic, but the low-pressure activation energy is large. Sample calculations in Chapter 14 assume the use of acetone as a carbon source. Various strategies can enable the use of reactive molecules like ethyne as feedstocks; for example, they could be made to form bound complexes in an early, low-pressure stage, permitting later purification and orientation stages to handle a less reactive structure.

[^33]:     mill $n$ : Any of various machines for making something by some action done again and again. (Webster's New World Dictionary)

[^34]:     An error rate of $10^{-15}$ corresponds to a mean time to failure of $\sim 3000$ years for a single device working at $10^{4}$ operations per second. The failure rate of a mill module might be dominated by one device with an error rate of $10^{-15}$, while a hundred others work with error rates of $\leq 10^{-18}$ (a factor of $10^{3}$ in failure rate corresponds to a difference of $<30 \mathrm{maJ}$ in barrier height). The net mean time to failure then is still $\sim 3000$ years.

[^35]:     Note that the arm discussed in this Section 13.4 can easily apply $1 \mathrm{nN}$ forces, enabling it to lift $10^{-10} \mathrm{~kg}$ against terrestrial gravity. This is $\sim 10^{9}$ times the mass of the arm itself.

[^36]:     Damage to a large fraction of units in a set increases the operation and damage rates of the remaining units, but this makes a negligible adverse contribution to overall system reliability.

[^56]: The ratios of the times and energies consumed by a typical nanomechanical computation operation to the times and energies consumed by a typical robotic arm motion are enormously greater than the corresponding ratios for microprocessor computation and macromechanical robotic arm motions. J. S. Hall has noted that this favors a shift away from moment-by-moment computer control of arm trajectories; the approach described here reflects this preference.

[^37]:     P. Barth has expressed concern that breaching the vacuum containment of a manufacturing system would cause its premature oxidation (i.e., that the finely-divided, carbonrich nanomechanical components would burn). Note, however, that little of the mass of the system described serves a chemical or interfacial role; most of the mass serves as structure (including the interiors of moving parts). In systems to be used in environments where combustibility is a safety concern, much of this structural mass can be made from incombustible materials (e.g., aluminum oxide; see Table 9.1) with little change in overall design. Internal water reservoirs may also be useful.

[^38]:     CAD systems are automating more functions, and research in entirely automated design is underway. Accordingly, this statement is becoming debatable.

[^39]:     The computational analogue would be a comparatively simple massively parallel SISD machine, pointlessly producing many instances of the same answer. In manufacturing, applying the same operation ("single instruction") to identical objects ("single datum") is more useful, producing multiple instances of a physical object.

[^40]:     Save for editing and partial updating of citations, the material in this section is drawn from Drexler (1989b).

[^41]:     In the following sections, values cited as $\sim 7 \mathrm{maJ}$ are to be regarded as round numbers, representing $\sim 1 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}$.

[^42]:     Portions of the discussion in this section are based on Drexler $(1991 b, 1992)$.

[^43]:     J. Bonaventura has suggested the use of liquid xenon (e.g., at $16 \mathrm{C}, 58 \mathrm{~atm}$ ) as a solvent (Rentzepis and Douglass, 1981); this may avoid some of these constraints. Xenon has little interaction with (e.g.) reactive organic radicals (Cook and Roberts, 1983).

[^44]:     Martensitic transitions have desirable properties: they transform one solid structure into another, are cooperative, occur through local structural displacements, require no diffusion, cause little change in entropy, and can propagate at speeds near that of sound.

[^45]:     This has previously been called exploratory engineering (Drexler, 1991a), a term that does not adequately convey the theoretical nature of the studies. The term theoretical applied science could be applied to theoretical studies performed in direct support of experimental applied science, but applied theoretical science seems a better term. No clearer alternative name for the present topic has yet been suggested.

[^46]:     For example, if a war were in progress, and $\mathrm{X}$ could be used to destroy the country, and a defense against $\mathrm{X}$ would cost one billion dollars, then the expected value of this information could be on the order of $5 \%$ of the value of the country, minus one billion dollars. If determining the possibility or impossibility of $\mathrm{X}$ with near certainty can be achieved promptly at a cost of only one million dollars, so much the better.

[^47]:    The idea that experimentally unfalsifiable statements can be tested against established theory has been discussed in the philosophy of science literature by Wisdom (1963).

[^48]:     Diverse work in "nanotechnology" is reviewed by Franks (1987), but the then-new term was taken by that author as possibly including glass polishing and fine-powder technologies. Taniguchi (1974) applied 'Nano-technology' (in this form, with quotes) to processes such as ion sputtering. A broad and uneven survey of pre-1980 speculations regarding small devices of various kinds appears in Schneiker (1989). Recent collections of papers organized around molecular nanotechnology in the present sense appear in the proceedings of the First and Second Foresight Conferences on Molecular Nanotechnology, held in 1989 and 1991 (Crandall and Lewis, 1992; Teague, 1992).

[^49]:     The Department of Synthetic Chemistry at the University of Tokyo, however, is in the Faculty of Engineering.

[^50]:     This system is modeled on Atkins (1974).

[^51]:     Some textbooks state a slightly weaker form: a reaction that converts perfect crystals at absolute zero into other perfect crystals at absolute zero results in no change in entropy. This is essentially equivalent.
